# Longhorn Chart

> **Important**: Please install the Longhorn chart in the `longhorn-system` namespace only.

> **Warning**: Longhorn doesn't support downgrading from a higher version to a lower version.

> **Note**: Use Helm 3 when installing and upgrading Longhorn. Helm 2 is [no longer supported](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-2-becomes-unsupported/).

## Source Code

Longhorn is 100% open source software. Project source code is spread across a number of repos:

1. Longhorn Engine -- Core controller/replica logic https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-engine
2. Longhorn Instance Manager -- Controller/replica instance lifecycle management https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-instance-manager
3. Longhorn Share Manager -- NFS provisioner that exposes Longhorn volumes as ReadWriteMany volumes. https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-share-manager
4. Backing Image Manager -- Backing image file lifecycle management. https://github.com/longhorn/backing-image-manager
5. Longhorn Manager -- Longhorn orchestration, includes CSI driver for Kubernetes https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager
6. Longhorn UI -- Dashboard https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-ui

## Prerequisites

1. A container runtime compatible with Kubernetes (Docker v1.13+, containerd v1.3.7+, etc.)
2. Kubernetes >= v1.21
3. Make sure `bash`, `curl`, `findmnt`, `grep`, `awk` and `blkid` has been installed in all nodes of the Kubernetes cluster.
4. Make sure `open-iscsi` has been installed, and the `iscsid` daemon is running on all nodes of the Kubernetes cluster. For GKE, recommended Ubuntu as guest OS image since it contains `open-iscsi` already.

## Upgrading to Kubernetes v1.25+

Starting in Kubernetes v1.25, [Pod Security Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/) have been removed from the Kubernetes API.

As a result, **before upgrading to Kubernetes v1.25** (or on a fresh install in a Kubernetes v1.25+ cluster), users are expected to perform an in-place upgrade of this chart with `enablePSP` set to `false` if it has been previously set to `true`.

> **Note:**
> If you upgrade your cluster to Kubernetes v1.25+ before removing PSPs via a `helm upgrade` (even if you manually clean up resources), **it will leave the Helm release in a broken state within the cluster such that further Helm operations will not work (`helm uninstall`, `helm upgrade`, etc.).**
>
> If your charts get stuck in this state, you may have to clean up your Helm release secrets.
Upon setting `enablePSP` to false, the chart will remove any PSP resources deployed on its behalf from the cluster. This is the default setting for this chart.

As a replacement for PSPs, [Pod Security Admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) should be used. Please consult the Longhorn docs for more details on how to configure your chart release namespaces to work with the new Pod Security Admission and apply Pod Security Standards.

## Installation

1. Add Longhorn chart repository.
```
helm repo add longhorn https://charts.longhorn.io
```

2. Update local Longhorn chart information from chart repository.
```
helm repo update
```

3. Use the following commands to create the `longhorn-system` namespace first, then install the Longhorn chart.

```
kubectl create namespace longhorn-system
helm install longhorn longhorn/longhorn --namespace longhorn-system
```

## Uninstallation

```
kubectl -n longhorn-system patch -p '{"value": "true"}' --type=merge lhs deleting-confirmation-flag
helm uninstall longhorn -n longhorn-system
kubectl delete namespace longhorn-system
```

| defaultSettings.allowEmptyNodeSelectorVolume | Setting that allows scheduling of empty node selector volumes to any node. |
| defaultSettings.allowRecurringJobWhileVolumeDetached | Setting that allows Longhorn to automatically attach a volume and create snapshots or backups when recurring jobs are run. |
| defaultSettings.allowVolumeCreationWithDegradedAvailability | Setting that allows you to create and attach a volume without having all replicas scheduled at the time of creation. |
| defaultSettings.autoCleanupRecurringJobBackupSnapshot | Setting that allows Longhorn to automatically clean up the snapshot generated by a recurring backup job. |
| defaultSettings.autoCleanupSnapshotWhenDeleteBackup | Setting that automatically cleans up the snapshot when the backup is deleted. |
| defaultSettings.autoCleanupSystemGeneratedSnapshot | Setting that allows Longhorn to automatically clean up the system-generated snapshot after replica rebuilding is completed. |
| defaultSettings.autoDeletePodWhenVolumeDetachedUnexpectedly | Setting that allows Longhorn to automatically delete a workload pod that is managed by a controller (for example, daemonset) whenever a Longhorn volume is detached unexpectedly (for example, during Kubernetes upgrades). After deletion, the controller restarts the pod and then Kubernetes handles volume reattachment and remounting. |
| defaultSettings.autoSalvage | Setting that allows Longhorn to automatically salvage volumes when all replicas become faulty (for example, when the network connection is interrupted). Longhorn determines which replicas are usable and then uses these replicas for the volume. This setting is enabled by default. |
| defaultSettings.backingImageCleanupWaitInterval | Number of minutes that Longhorn waits before cleaning up the backing image file when no replicas in the disk are using it. |
| defaultSettings.backingImageRecoveryWaitInterval | Number of seconds that Longhorn waits before downloading a backing image file again when the status of all image disk files changes to "failed" or "unknown". |

When the value is "0", Longhorn does not automatically upgrade volume engines to the new default engine image version. |
| defaultSettings.concurrentReplicaRebuildPerNodeLimit | Maximum number of replicas that can be concurrently rebuilt on each node. |
| defaultSettings.concurrentVolumeBackupRestorePerNodeLimit | Maximum number of volumes that can be concurrently restored on each node using a backup. When the value is "0", restoration of volumes using a backup is disabled. |
| defaultSettings.createDefaultDiskLabeledNodes | Setting that allows Longhorn to automatically create a default disk only on nodes with the label "node.longhorn.io/create-default-disk=true" (if no other disks exist). When this setting is disabled, Longhorn creates a default disk on each node that is added to the cluster. |
| defaultSettings.defaultDataLocality | Default data locality. A Longhorn volume has data locality if a local replica of the volume exists on the same node as the pod that is using the volume. |
| defaultSettings.defaultDataPath | Default path for storing data on a host. The default value is "/var/lib/longhorn/". |
| defaultSettings.defaultLonghornStaticStorageClass | Default Longhorn StorageClass. "storageClassName" is assigned to PVs and PVCs that are created for an existing Longhorn volume. "storageClassName" can also be used as a label, so it is possible to use a Longhorn StorageClass to bind a workload to an existing PV without creating a Kubernetes StorageClass object. The default value is "longhorn-static". |

This setting applies only to volumes created using the Longhorn UI. |
| defaultSettings.disableSchedulingOnCordonedNode | Setting that prevents Longhorn Manager from scheduling replicas on a cordoned Kubernetes node. This setting is enabled by default. |
| defaultSettings.disableSnapshotPurge | Setting that temporarily prevents all attempts to purge volume snapshots. |
| defaultSettings.engineReplicaTimeout | Timeout between the Longhorn Engine and replicas. Specify a value between "8" and "30" seconds. The default value is "8". |
| defaultSettings.failedBackupTTL | Number of minutes that Longhorn keeps a failed backup resource. When the value is "0", automatic deletion is disabled. |

| defaultSettings.offlineReplicaRebuilding | Setting that allows rebuilding of offline replicas for volumes using the V2 Data Engine. |
| defaultSettings.orphanAutoDeletion | Setting that allows Longhorn to automatically delete an orphaned resource and the corresponding data (for example, stale replicas). Orphaned resources on failed or unknown nodes are not automatically cleaned up. |
| defaultSettings.priorityClass | PriorityClass for system-managed Longhorn components. This setting can help prevent Longhorn components from being evicted under Node Pressure. Notice that this will be applied to Longhorn user-deployed components by default if there are no priority class values set yet, such as `longhornManager.priorityClass`. |
| defaultSettings.recurringFailedJobsHistoryLimit | Maximum number of failed recurring backup and snapshot jobs to be retained. When the value is "0", a history of failed recurring jobs is not retained. |
| defaultSettings.recurringJobMaxRetention | Maximum number of snapshots or backups to be retained. |
| defaultSettings.recurringSuccessfulJobsHistoryLimit | Maximum number of successful recurring backup and snapshot jobs to be retained. When the value is "0", a history of successful recurring jobs is not retained. |
| defaultSettings.removeSnapshotsDuringFilesystemTrim | Setting that allows Longhorn to automatically mark the latest snapshot and its parent files as removed during a filesystem trim. Longhorn does not remove snapshots containing multiple child files. |
| defaultSettings.replicaAutoBalance | Setting that automatically rebalances replicas when an available node is discovered. |
| defaultSettings.replicaDiskSoftAntiAffinity | Setting that allows scheduling on disks with existing healthy replicas of the same volume. This setting is enabled by default. |
| defaultSettings.replicaFileSyncHttpClientTimeout | Number of seconds that an HTTP client waits for a response from a File Sync server before considering the connection to have failed. |
| defaultSettings.replicaReplenishmentWaitInterval | Number of seconds that Longhorn waits before reusing existing data on a failed replica instead of creating a new replica of a degraded volume. |
| defaultSettings.replicaSoftAntiAffinity | Setting that allows scheduling on nodes with healthy replicas of the same volume. This setting is disabled by default. |
| defaultSettings.replicaZoneSoftAntiAffinity | Setting that allows Longhorn to schedule new replicas of a volume to nodes in the same zone as existing healthy replicas. Nodes that do not belong to any zone are treated as existing in the zone that contains healthy replicas. When identifying zones, Longhorn relies on the label "topology.kubernetes.io/zone=<Zone name of the node>" in the Kubernetes node object. |
| defaultSettings.restoreConcurrentLimit | Maximum number of worker threads that can concurrently run for each restore operation. |
| defaultSettings.restoreVolumeRecurringJobs | Setting that restores recurring jobs from a backup volume on a backup target and creates recurring jobs if none exist during backup restoration. |
| defaultSettings.snapshotDataIntegrity | Setting that allows you to enable and disable snapshot hashing and data integrity checks. |
| defaultSettings.snapshotDataIntegrityCronjob | Setting that defines when Longhorn checks the integrity of data in snapshot disk files. You must use the Unix cron expression format. |
| defaultSettings.snapshotDataIntegrityImmediateCheckAfterSnapshotCreation | Setting that allows disabling of snapshot hashing after snapshot creation to minimize impact on system performance. |
| defaultSettings.snapshotMaxCount | Maximum snapshot count for a volume. The value should be between 2 to 250 |
| defaultSettings.storageMinimalAvailablePercentage | Percentage of minimum available disk capacity. When the minimum available capacity exceeds the total available capacity, the disk becomes unschedulable until more space is made available for use. The default value is "25". |
| defaultSettings.storageNetwork | Storage network for in-cluster traffic. When unspecified, Longhorn uses the Kubernetes cluster network. |
| defaultSettings.storageOverProvisioningPercentage | Percentage of storage that can be allocated relative to hard drive capacity. The default value is "100". |
| defaultSettings.storageReservedPercentageForDefaultDisk | Percentage of disk space that is not allocated to the default disk on each new Longhorn node. |
| defaultSettings.supportBundleFailedHistoryLimit | Maximum number of failed support bundles that can exist in the cluster. When the value is "0", Longhorn automatically purges all failed support bundles. |
| defaultSettings.systemManagedComponentsNodeSelector | Node selector for system-managed Longhorn components. |
| defaultSettings.systemManagedPodsImagePullPolicy | Image pull policy for system-managed pods, such as Instance Manager, engine images, and CSI Driver. Changes to the image pull policy are applied only after the system-managed pods restart. |
| defaultSettings.taintToleration | Taint or toleration for system-managed Longhorn components. Specify values using a semicolon-separated list in `kubectl taint` syntax (Example: key1=value1:effect; key2=value2:effect). |
| defaultSettings.upgradeChecker | Upgrade Checker that periodically checks for new Longhorn versions. When a new version is available, a notification appears on the Longhorn UI. This setting is enabled by default |
| defaultSettings.v1DataEngine | Setting that allows you to enable the V1 Data Engine. |
| defaultSettings.v2DataEngine | Setting that allows you to enable the V2 Data Engine, which is based on the Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK). The V2 Data Engine is a preview feature and should not be used in production environments. |
| defaultSettings.v2DataEngineGuaranteedInstanceManagerCPU | Number of millicpus on each node to be reserved for each Instance Manager pod when the V2 Data Engine is enabled. The default value is "1250". |
| defaultSettings.v2DataEngineHugepageLimit | Setting that allows you to configure maximum huge page size (in MiB) for the V2 Data Engine. |
| defaultSettings.v2DataEngineLogFlags | Setting that allows you to configure the log flags of the SPDK target daemon (spdk_tgt) of the V2 Data Engine. |
| defaultSettings.v2DataEngineLogLevel | Setting that allows you to configure the log level of the SPDK target daemon (spdk_tgt) of the V2 Data Engine. |
