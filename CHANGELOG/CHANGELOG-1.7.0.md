## Longhorn v1.7.0 Release Notes

This latest version of Longhorn introduces several features, enhancements, and bug fixes that are intended to improve system quality and the overall user experience. Highlights include new V2 Data Engine features, platform-agnostic deployment, high availability, and improvements to data protection, stability, performance, and resilience.

The Longhorn team appreciates your contributions and anticipates receiving feedback regarding this release.

For more information about release-related terminology, see [Releases](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn#releases).


> [!WARNING]
> The Longhorn team has identified [a critical issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9267) that affects volume attachment in Longhorn v1.7.0. We are currently working on releasing v1.7.1, which will be available soon. If your Longhorn cluster contains `engine` resources with names in the format `<volume name>-e-<8-char random id>` that are created before v1.5.2 and v1.4.4, please put v1.7.0 upgrade on hold until v1.7.1 is available.
>
> You can use the following command to check if it is safe to upgrade your Longhorn cluster to v1.7.0:
>
> ```
> [ $(kubectl -n longhorn-system get engines.longhorn.io -o name | grep -E '\-e\-[a-z0-9]{8}$' | wc -l) -gt 0 ] && echo "Please hold off on upgrading to v1.7.0 until v1.7.1 is available." || echo "Safe to upgrade to v1.7.0."
> ```

## Deprecation & Incompatibilities

The functionality of the [environment check script](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/v1.7.x/scripts/environment_check.sh) overlaps with that of the Longhorn CLI, which is available starting with v1.7.0. Because of this, the script is deprecated in v1.7.0 and is scheduled for removal in v1.8.0.

For information about important changes, including feature incompatibility, deprecation, and removal, see [Important Notes](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.7.0/deploy/important-notes/) in the Longhorn documentation.

## Primary Highlights

### New V2 Data Engine Features

Although the V2 Data Engine is still considered a preview feature in this release, the core functions have been significantly enhanced.

- [Online replica rebuilding](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7199): Allows Longhorn to rebuild replicas while the volume is running without any IO interruptions.
- [Filesystem trim](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7534): Reclaims unused space more effectively.
- [Block-type disk support for SPDK AIO, NVMe and VirtIO Bdev drivers](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7672): Broadens the range of compatible hardware and improves performance in high-demand environments.
- [V2 volume support for data plane live upgrade](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6001): Enables upgrading of the spdk_tgt process, which handles IO operations, without any downtime. Coverage of the live upgrade function will be extended to the control plane in a future release.

The Longhorn team will continue to develop features for the V1 Data Engine and to prepare the V2 Data Engine for use in all types of environments.

### Platform-Agnostic Deployment

Longhorn is designed to seamlessly operate on general-purpose Linux distributions and certain container-optimized operating systems. v1.7.0 provides robust and efficient persistent storage solutions for Kubernetes clusters running on [Container-Optimized OS (COS)](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6165).

### High Availability

v1.7.0 introduces features that enhance system resilience and address potential single points of failure. 

- [High availability for backing images](github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2856): Mitigates risks associated with image failures. 
- [RWX volumes fast failover](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6205): Enables rapid detection of and response to Share Manager pod failures (independent of the timing and sequence of Kubernetes node failures).

### Data Protection

Starting with v1.7.0, Longhorn supports [periodic and on-demand full backups](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7070) that help reduce the likelihood of backup corruption and enhance the overall reliability of the backup process.

### Scheduling

The [replica auto-balancing](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4105) feature was enhanced to address disk space pressure from growing volumes. These enhancements reduce manual intervention by automatically rebalancing replicas under disk pressure and improve performance with faster replica rebuilding through local file copying.

### Storage Network

The storage network now [supports RWX volumes]((https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/8184)) with network segregation, enabling dedicated traffic lanes for storage operations.

### Longhorn CLI

The [Longhorn CLI](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7927), which is the official Longhorn command line tool, is introduced in v1.7.0. This tool interacts with Longhorn by creating Kubernetes custom resources (CRs) and executing commands inside a dedicated pod for in-cluster and host operations. Usage scenarios include installation, operations such as exporting replicas, and troubleshooting.

## Installation

>  [!IMPORTANT]
**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.21 or later before installing Longhorn v1.7.0.**

You can install Longhorn using a variety of tools, including Rancher, Kubectl, and Helm. For more information about installation methods and requirements, see [Quick Installation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.7.0/deploy/install/) in the Longhorn documentation.

## Upgrade

>  [!IMPORTANT]
**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.21 or later before upgrading from Longhorn v1.6.x to v1.7.0.**

Longhorn only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrade](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.7.0/deploy/upgrade/) in the Longhorn documentation.
